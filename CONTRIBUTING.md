```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/devHW.git
cd devHW
git remote add [nick] https://github.com/ORIGINAL-username/devHW.git

```
The [nick] is a name you can remember because you will use it in some fetch and
  pull commands. For instance, hybotix uses "hybo" for the [nick].

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

This will checkout your branch set you up to edit on that branch of the repo.

```bash
git add [changed document or directory name]
git commit -m "Added [changed document or directory name], [explain what you did]"
```

Note: You can also do
```bash
git commit
```

and edit the commit message inside your default editor.

### Step 5: Submit a Pull Request (PR)
1. Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
